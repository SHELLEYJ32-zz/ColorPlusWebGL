Color Plus is a cooperative two-player action puzzle game, playable in a web browser. One player uses the keyboard, and the other uses the mouse. Use this link to play: https://shelleyj32.github.io/ColorPlusWebGL/.

Keyboard Player: You press 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 and the next cube will appear in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th row, BUT in random column. If you fails to press before the turn ends (2 sec), then a random available cube turns black. Means you cannot remove it anymore! You also lose 1 point.

Mouse Player: Any time you click a colored cube (non-white, non-black) in the grid, the cube should activate. If you click it again, it should deactivate. You can move the activated cube to adjacent available directions, including diagonals!

Scoring:

5 colored cubes all of 1 color in a + configuration, 10 points
5 colored cubes, one of each color, in a + configuration, 5 points
Lose 1 point whenever you fail to type 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 before the turn ends
